# Tomb Of the Mask Javascript Edition
Remake of the original "Tomb Of the Mask" mobile game.

## Gameplay
The game consists of taking all the **stars** on the map. To move you will use the arrows if you are on PC and the swipe if you are on mobile.

The levels also feature two traps. The first **"static spikes"** will only kill you if you physically walk over them, while the other **"dynamic spikes"** will activate when they pass and, if you don't clear the area immediately, you will be killed.

To finish the level you will have to get to where the **glowing** square is. Once you reach the "finish line", a screen will appear that allows you to return to the home page.
